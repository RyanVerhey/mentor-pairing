# How to Contribute to Pairing is Caring

1. Fork the repo
2. Run the test suite. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and
it's great to know that you have a clean slate to start: `bundle && rake spec:all`
3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test!
4. Make the test pass.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
